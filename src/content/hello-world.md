नमस्ते 	&middot; Hello &middot; Konnichiwa &middot; হেৰি &middot; สวัสดี &middot; مرحبًا &middot; Ni hao

Above are greetings in seven different languages: Hindi, English, Japanese, Assamese, Thai, Arabic and Malay, in order from left to right. I welcome you aboard to my little crapping digital space (r.i.p the luxury of physical space 🇮🇳).

> Fun Fact:  These are all the languages I’ve spoken in or national language of the places I’ve been to.

No, This is not an article on [localization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Internationalization). And yes, I did google most of the translations. Now while the introductory article is usually kept a way of testing the waters, I am going to throw caution to the wind, virtue of the solid average content at display from the get go.   

Now, for the good or the bad (mostly bad), I am your friendly neighbourhood frontend developer. So, while my technical content revolve around it, I want to document my foray into backend and personal experiences as well. To state briefly:

- <b>Frontend projects</b>: Primarily being a frontend developer, my exploration and ~~miscarriage~~ mishaps from building projects
- Tools for enhancing developer productivity, setting up workflows and primariily show off to peers
- Mapping my foray into backend development (nascent stages)
- Rants from time to time about, hopefully not as frequent as tech blogging itself
